Push 1 Organelle Desktop Mother Patch
-------------------------------------

Remaps the Organelle Mother Patch to work with the Push 1. The keyboard mapping has been removed. 

Tested on OSX with PD-Extended. 

Mapping
=======
- Knob1-4 -> Organelle Knob1-4
- Knob 9 -> Organelle Volume
- Tap Tempo Button -> Aux Button
- Stop Button -> DSP Off and Volume 0
- Play button -> DSP on
- LCD Lines 1-3 -> Organelle ScreenLine Messages 1-5
- LCD Line 3.5 -> Organelle Volume display

TODO
====
- Test with Purr-Data (2.4.3 doesn't have sysex out, do later versions have it?)
- Test on Raspberry Pi
- Add select knob mapping
- add foot input mapping (exp and fs)
